This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to text, social media, and web analytics by analyzing three major data streams—tweets, customer reviews, and news headlines. Through data cleaning, NLP-driven sentiment classification, trend detection, and multi-source visualization, the analysis uncovers how public opinion shifts, emotional narratives, and trending topics influence business demand, brand performance, and market outcomes. The results highlight the power of text analytics in supporting marketing, forecasting, and strategic decision-making.
